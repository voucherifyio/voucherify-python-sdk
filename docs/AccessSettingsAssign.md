# AccessSettingsAssign

Assigns the campaign to an area or a store. Provide the area and/or store IDs in the respective arrays. If a campaign changes assignments between areas or stores, unassign it from the area. For example, if a campaign is assigned to Area-01, but it must be now assigned to Store-01 within this area, you have to unassign the campaign from Area-01 and assign to Store-01 only.  If you want to assign the campaign to stores only, you do not have to send the area ID.
